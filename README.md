# BatteryReborn
LibGDX version of Battery.

## Original description
Browser based 2D scrolling shooter written in Java. The player controls 
an airplane in a top-down view and shoots down enemy planes, helicopters and tanks.

## State
**05.08.2019** I was doing a lot of clean up and small refactoring. Code is cleaner and more readable but still, refactoring to solid architecture isn't trivial.

**21.07.2019** With some hacks it's working as original version. It needs refactoring to make use of LibGDX features.

**20.07.2019** It's just empty LibGDX project with all the code from servlet implementation.
It needs to be rewritten from servlet to LibGDX drawing.

## Thanks
Maxim Markaitis for creating original game, which you can find at https://sourceforge.net/projects/battery/
