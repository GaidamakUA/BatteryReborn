# BatteryReborn
LibGDX version of Battery.

## Original description
Browser based 2D scrolling shooter written in Java. The player controls 
an airplane in a top-down view and shoots down enemy planes, helicopters and tanks.

## State
**20.07.2019** It's just empty LibGDX project with all the code from servlet implementation.
It needs to be rewritten from servlet to LibGDX drawing.

## Thanks
Maxim Markaitis for creating original game, which you can find at https://sourceforge.net/projects/battery/
